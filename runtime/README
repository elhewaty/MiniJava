File boot.c provides the interface between compiled code and the host
system.  File demo.s is an assembly language program that shows how
this interface works.  To run compiled minijava programs, compile the
generated assembly language (.s) file with boot.c to produce an
executable file.

Additional "runtime" functions can be added to boot.c and called from
compiled code if desired.
